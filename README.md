In this project multiplication is done as the series of repeated addition by generating partial products and finally adding them. The modified Booth Algorithm is used to reduce the number of partial products generated by a factor of 2, that is half of partial product generated using normal multiplication. The multiplicand is considered as the number to be added and the multiplier is the number of times that it is added.Thus final result is calculated by the addition of all generated partial product.
